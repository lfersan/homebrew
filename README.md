# 3DS Homebrew Hub

Landing content for the GitHub Pages site that walks visitors through the core tools used to manage and customize a modded 3DS.

## Navigation Cards
1. **hShop** - Grab digital games, themes, and updates directly on the console.
2. **Anemone3DS** - Install, preview, and rotate custom system themes.
3. **LumaLocaleSwitcher** - Force region/language settings per title for imports.
4. **FBI** - Manage `.cia` files and manually install content from the SD card.

### hShop - Titles & Themes
**Why visit:** hShop is the primary storefront replacement for fetching games and themes. The interface is intentionally simple so anyone can browse and install without extra setup.

**Download flow**
1. Launch hShop from the HOME Menu.
2. Jump to **Games** or **Themes** depending on what you need.
3. Pick the `Europe (EUR)` region to surface compatible entries.
4. Scroll through the list; every visible title works in that region.
5. Highlight an item, tap `A`, and press `A` again to download/install.

**Storage tip:** The lower edge of the top screen shows available SD space, so confirm you have enough free storage before starting larger downloads to avoid failures.

### Anemone3DS - Theme Manager
**Why visit:** Install and curate custom themes in seconds, complete with previews and automated shuffling.

**Install a theme**
1. Launch Anemone3DS.
2. Press `Y` to scan the `/themes/` folder on the SD card.
3. Browse with the D-pad to highlight a theme.
4. Press `A` to install.
5. Hit `Start` to exit; your theme applies immediately.

**Extras available at the bottom bar**
- Randomize themes on wake
- Shuffle through your collection
- Preview layouts before committing

### LumaLocaleSwitcher - Region Fixes
**Best for:** Imported cartridges or eShop titles that demand a certain locale before booting.

**How to apply a locale**
1. Launch LumaLocaleSwitcher.
2. Browse the installed titles list.
3. Select the game that needs a locale override (many imports default to Japanese).
4. Set `Region -> EUR` and `Language -> ENG`.
5. Confirm, exit, and launch the game; Luma auto-applies the patch during boot.

---

### FBI - Manual Installs
**Why visit:** FBI is the go-to file manager for the homebrew community when installing CIA packages, deleting titles, or checking ticket info.

**Install games via SD card**
1. Open FBI from the HOME Menu.
2. Navigate with the D-pad.
3. Choose **SD** and browse to the folder housing the `.cia` (for example `/games/`).
4. Select the CIA and pick **Install and delete** (or **Install** if you want to keep the file).
5. Wait for completion; the newly installed content appears alongside your other titles.
